what if the developer used another annotation that is not in AnnotationUtils .. the code will be always V999 

one of the solution to make an annotation code for the attributes that are not annotated : 
[EmailAddress][V500] 
Email

but in this case we need the developer to be alerted to the number and to make sure it is unique .. 

another solution is to restrict developer from using any other data annotations , and if he needed specific one , he can contribute to the project
